# revbot
Just an automation to claim jobs at http://rev.com/. Unfinished selenium functions, but works if you know some python. The playwright bot works better and fast on msedge.

Note #1: This is a messy code, I was starting to learn about python at first and I'm still learning, but the playwright version used to work fine last time I checked. Be sure to insert your login, password and everything else at revver/config.py.

Note #2: I can't improve this bot or fix any bugs anymore since I lost my access to my friends rev account. If you need help to run this reach me out on daniel@danielferraz.dev
